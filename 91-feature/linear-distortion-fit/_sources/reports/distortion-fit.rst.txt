Distortion fit
==============

How the distortion of ESIS-I is fit to the flight data, and how to reproduce
the fit committed to the package.

The merit
---------

The fit compares an image of the Sun seen by another instrument (the AIA
proxy scene, :func:`esis.flights.f1.data.synth.scene_aia`) with a Level-1
frame, after imaging the scene through the model of one channel.  The
image is made by :class:`esis.optics.LinearMerit`: the channel is
linearized (:meth:`optika.systems.SequentialSystem.linearize`), the scene
is clipped by the field stop in object space, and it is regridded
conservatively onto the sensor.  The merit is the Pearson correlation with
the frame.

Compared with the sparse ray trace this replaced, the linearized image has
no sampling noise, so the merit is deterministic and smooth, and it needs no
point-spread function: the footprint integral of the regrid is a physically
sized smoothing of its own.  It is three times cheaper per evaluation, and
the regrid runs on a GPU.  Applying the field stop per line, before the
lines are summed, is what keeps each line's spill-over out of its
neighbours' windows; a mask over the summed image does not.

The stages
----------

:func:`esis.flights.f1.optics.fit_distortion_reference` runs three stages
from the as-built model (:func:`esis.flights.f1.optics.as_built`) and the
data alone.

1.  **Absolute.**  Each channel is fit on its own with
    :func:`esis.optics.fit_distortion`: a seeded differential evolution with
    a loose tolerance, which only has to land in the basin, followed by a
    restarted Nelder-Mead polish.  The capture is required: from the
    as-built model a local method alone fails on two channels of four, and
    from starts displaced by a tenth of the bounds it fails five times in
    twelve.  Because the merit is deterministic and the capture is seeded,
    the stage is reproducible.  Every parameter is free here, the sensor
    placement included.  Holding the sensor at its as-built value, so that
    only the internal alignment would move it, was tried: on the as-built
    model three channels of four then stall at 0.70 to 0.76 in correlation
    where the full set reaches 0.78 to 0.82, and neither freeing the
    focus-preserving distance alone nor starting from the design model
    closes the gap.  The price is that the capture searches fifteen
    dimensions, about two hours per channel on one GPU, and that the second,
    smaller simplex of the polish is what carries channel 0 the last five
    hundredths.
2.  **Shared.**  The primary displacement, the field-stop roll and the
    payload pitch and yaw belong to the instrument, and a fit which lets
    them differ per channel is using them as stand-ins for the camera
    placement.  They are set to their mean over the channels and each
    channel's own terms are polished again, the channels side by side in
    worker processes.  The polish costs nothing in correlation and gains a
    few thousandths, since the polish of the absolute stage had not
    converged.  About three hours.
3.  **Internal.**  A fit against the proxy scene places a channel to about
    a pixel; the channels compared with one another on the sky plane resolve
    a tenth of a pixel.  :func:`esis.optics.align_channels` samples every
    channel's frame on a common sky grid through its own distortion at
    He I 584 and O V 630, measures the tile shifts against channel 1, and
    solves for the increments of the grating and camera terms whose change
    of the mapping reproduces the shifts.  Using two lines separates a
    geometric error from a dispersion error.  Three passes of forty seconds
    reach the floor of the measurement, about a fifth of a pixel.  The
    pointing, the primary and the field stop are never revised by this
    stage.

The parameters
--------------

:class:`esis.optics.DistortionParameters` carries, per channel, the grating
yaw, pitch and roll, the ruling spacing, the azimuth offset, and the sensor
placement: a focus-preserving distance, roll, pitch, yaw, and in-plane
translation.  The sensor terms are what let one channel's mapping differ
from another's by a scale, an anisotropy and a rotation, which is what the
internal alignment measures and which none of the other parameters can
produce.  The distance is compound: the sensor moves by the parameter and
the grating by :obj:`esis.optics.KAPPA_FOCUS` times less along the beam, so
that the magnification changes without the focus.  The ratio is measured on
the model as 16.9, the longitudinal magnification of a system with a
magnification of four.

Reproducing the committed fit
-----------------------------

The scripts under ``docs/reports/distortion_fit`` run the stages on a
Slurm cluster::

    sbatch --job-name=dist-channel --array=0-3 reproduce.sbatch channel <dir>
    sbatch --job-name=dist-combine reproduce.sbatch combine <dir>
    sbatch --job-name=dist-pointing --array=0-29 reproduce.sbatch pointing <dir>
    sbatch --job-name=dist-gather reproduce.sbatch gather <dir>

The first produces one ECSV per channel, the second the committed
``distortion_reference.ecsv``, the last two the committed
``distortion_pointing.ecsv``: the payload pitch, yaw and roll of every
frame relative to the reference frame, from a polish of the mean merit of
the four channels in those three terms alone.  The fit of the reference
frame by itself lands 0.3 arcsec in pitch, 0.1 arcsec in yaw and 12 arcsec
in roll from the reference, which is the gap between the mean of four
merits in three terms and every channel in every term; the table is taken
relative to it so that the reference frame is zero.  The yaw sweeps from
+3.6 arcsec at the first frame to -3.9 arcsec at the last.  The environment needs ``named_arrays`` and
``optika`` with device support, ``regridding`` 3.4 with ``torch``, and a
``numba`` that can see the CUDA driver.  Loading the Level-1 frames peaks
above 100 GB of memory, which the job script asks for.

Results
-------

The correlation of each channel with its frame after each stage of the
reproduction on tempest, from the focused as-built model:

===========  ======  ======  ======  ======
stage         ch0     ch1     ch2     ch3
===========  ======  ======  ======  ======
as-built     0.350   0.419   0.404   0.379
absolute     0.776   0.833   0.791   0.818
shared       0.789   0.845   0.799   0.828
aligned      0.787   0.845   0.796   0.826
===========  ======  ======  ======  ======

The shared stage costs nothing, and gains where the polish of the absolute
stage had stopped early.  The alignment moves the median tile shift against
channel 1 from 0.87, 0.78 and 1.31 px (channels 0, 2 and 3) to 0.24, 0.17
and 0.23 px, at a cost of at most 0.0024 in correlation.  The stages are
deterministic: the shared stage run twice, once serially and once in worker
processes, gave the same correlations to four decimals.

Acceptance
----------

The fit was accepted by inverting frames 14--16 with the MART pipeline at
production scale, with the mapping of the committed tables installed in
place of the previous reference.  Against the previous reference the
residual of every channel falls on every frame, by 1.9 to 2.1 percent on
channel 0, 2.5 to 2.7 on channel 1, 7.2 to 7.5 on channel 2 and 0.1 to 0.7
on channel 3, which is more than the affine coalignment patch achieved on
any channel.  The spurious velocity ramp across the field of view falls at
every line: at O V from 5.2 to 2.3 km/s, at O III from 2.7 to 1.9, at O IV
from 1.9 to 1.1, at Mg X from 0.31 to 0.14 and at He I from 0.60 to 0.27.

During development the same chain, run from scripts on an earlier model of
the instrument, reached ramps of 1.4, 1.5 and 0.8 km/s at O V, O III and
O IV with a smaller improvement on channel 0; the committed tables come
from the package pipeline on the as-built model of the flight, and are the
ones the pipeline reproduces.
