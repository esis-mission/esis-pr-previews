Calibrating the ESIS-I optics against the flight: a summary
============================================================

.. note::

   A two-page account of the distortion fit for a publication, with the
   minimum set of figures.  The full description of every stage, the
   committed numbers and the reproduction recipe are in
   :doc:`distortion-fit`.  The numbers are those of the committed tables.

Why a fit is needed
-------------------

ESIS is a slitless spectrograph: one primary mirror forms an image of the
Sun on an octagonal field stop, and four concave varied-line-space gratings,
each viewing that stop through its own sector of the primary's beam,
disperse the field at azimuths 45° apart onto four cameras.  Every bright
line makes a window on each sensor that is the image of the field stop at
that wavelength, and the spectral information lives in the differences
between the four dispersed images.  Recovering a spectrum at every point of
the field therefore requires the mapping from the sky to each sensor to a
small fraction of a pixel, across the field and through the flight: a
pixel is 0.75″ of sky, or 17 km/s of Doppler shift along the dispersion.
The pre-flight model, built from the design and the measured components,
places the images to a few pixels.  The flight data must supply the rest,
and they carry no calibration source: the only references are the Sun
itself, as seen by SDO/AIA at the same time, and the four channels seen
against one another.

The model and what the data can tell it
---------------------------------------

The instrument is modelled in optika as a sequential system of surfaces
with the real coatings, ruling functions and apertures, and is fit through
a small set of physical parameters per channel: the grating's three angles
and its ruling spacing, the sensor's position and three angles, the
instrument's pointing, and the position of the primary along the axis.  A
forward image is made by linearizing the model, a polynomial mapping from
sky and wavelength to the sensor with the vignetting and effective area
that the ray trace gives, and imaging a proxy scene through it: AIA's
171, 193 and 304 Å images resampled onto the sky as a stand-in for the
He I, O V and Mg X emission.  The merit of a parameter set is the
correlation of that image with the Level-1 frame.

One frame does not determine the parameters.  The singular values of the
mapping's Jacobian fall off a cliff after eight, so eight combinations of
the fifteen terms are measurable from a single image and the rest are
null directions: instrument pointing against grating tilt, sensor position
against grating angle, primary displacement against sensor distance.  Two
physical facts break the degeneracies.  The window edges are the image of
the field stop, so they do not move when the instrument's pointing moves
the Sun inside them, while a grating tilt moves edges and Sun together: the
edges separate the pointing from the grating.  And the four channels see
the same Sun at the same instant, so registering them against one another
on the sky resolves a tenth of a pixel where the proxy scene, at 2″
sampling and a different temperature response, resolves one.

The pipeline
------------

1. **Capture.**  For each channel, a seeded differential evolution over the
   nine identifiable terms against the reference frame, followed by a
   restarted Nelder–Mead polish.  This takes the model from a correlation
   of 0.35 to 0.80 with the frame.

2. **Window edges.**  The outline of every window is measured in every
   frame as error-function crossings, medianed over the flight; the
   per-frame departures from the median are kept as the drift of the
   windows.

3. **Outline and shared stages.**  The windows are placed on the measured
   edges with the grating angles and the sensor roll, the sky is refit
   with the remaining terms, the pointing is set to one value for all four
   channels, and the camera terms of each channel are polished.

4. **Internal alignment.**  Each channel's frame is read onto a common sky
   grid through its mapping at He I 584 Å and O V 630 Å, inside the window
   that line illuminates, and cross-correlated tile by tile against
   channel 1; the parameters are moved so that the mapping reproduces the
   measured shifts.  Two lines separate a geometric error, the same shift
   in both, from a dispersion error.

5. **Through the flight.**  The windows drift by up to 1.5 px, which the
   model reproduces as a rigid translation of the field stop of a few
   microns, and the pointing sweeps 6″ in yaw.  A per-frame fit of the
   common pointing, with the windows placed by the smoothed drift, follows
   the Sun.  The channels' skies also separate through the flight by up to
   0.5 px in a pattern no combination of pointing and grating tilt can
   make, since those move the edges too; an axial defocus of the primary
   does exactly that, because each channel views the defocused image
   through its own sector of the primary and sees it shifted along its own
   dispersion.  One defocus for the whole primary, measured from the
   channels against one another in every frame, takes out about a fifth of
   the separation; what remains is a translation of each channel's whole
   image inside its window, the same at both lines and smooth in time,
   which nothing after the field stop can produce.  A focus that differs
   from sector to sector reproduces it to the precision of the
   measurement, so the stage solves one focus per sector: four histories
   that differ by up to 49 µm, channel 0's holding within 8 µm of its
   value at the reference frame while channel 1's moves from −26 to
   +22 µm, channel 2's from +2 to +24 and channel 3's from −17 to +13,
   each smoothed by a quadratic in time.  A paraboloid has one focus for every
   zone, so if this is real the mirror's figure changed unevenly with
   temperature during the flight, by about 100 nm of sag between sectors;
   the edges the measurement rests on are soft enough that the data do not
   exclude part of it being the edges' apparent motion, see below.

6. **Acceptance.**  The fit is scored on frames it was not fit to, and the
   coalignment metric is measured in every frame: the whole-channel shift
   of each channel against channel 1, and the scatter of the tiles about
   it, in pixels.

Results
-------

The committed tables come from the chain run from scratch on the cluster
on 2026-10-08 and 2026-10-09 with the final code and the released
libraries (optika 3.1, named-arrays 2.14, regridding 3.5), on GPUs, from
the seed-0 captures, in six hours of wall time.  The correlation with the
reference frame after the capture is 0.803, 0.841, 0.803, 0.827 on
channels 0 to 3, after the shared polish 0.809, 0.851, 0.804, 0.828, and
on six frames across the flight that the fit never saw, with each frame's
pointing applied, a mean of 0.806, 0.848, 0.801, 0.824.  The internal
alignment leaves the channels 0.01, 0.00, 0.03, 0.03 px from channel 1 at
the reference frame.  The focus of each sector of the primary drifts over
the flight, by −8 to −4 µm on channel 0, −26 to +22 on channel 1, +2 to
+24 on channel 2 and −17 to +13 on channel 3, each a quadratic with 2 to
4 µm of scatter; their mean, the defocus of the primary as a whole, by
−12 to +14 µm.  The same chain run on the host without a GPU reproduces
every one of these numbers, the capture merits to seven figures and the
coalignment to 0.01 px, and a run from a different seed on the earlier
code reproduced them to 0.01 in correlation and 0.02 px in coalignment.

The coalignment metric, every channel but the anchor, over the
twenty-seven frames bright enough to measure, with one focus for the whole
primary and with one per sector:

=====  ================  ================  ====================  ============
line   rms shift         max shift         rms along dispersion  tile scatter
=====  ================  ================  ====================  ============
He I   0.20 to 0.11 px   0.62 to 0.22 px   3.3 to 1.7 km/s       0.35 px
O V    0.17 to 0.08 px   0.48 to 0.24 px   2.5 to 0.8 km/s       0.24 px
=====  ================  ================  ====================  ============

Only the part of a misregistration along a channel's dispersion is a
velocity error, and a pixel along the dispersion is 18.9 km/s at He I
and 17.4 km/s at O V.  With the pointing, the window drift and one
defocus of the whole primary the channels agree to a fifth of a pixel,
3 km/s, and part by up to 0.6 px in the first minute of the flight.  The
focus of each sector brings them to 0.11 and 0.08 px, 1.7 and 0.8 km/s,
with the worst single channel and frame at 4 km/s; a length taken from
two components each measured to 0.05 px cannot come out below 0.07 px, so
this is close to what the measurement resolves.  What the sector focus
leaves is also fit as an empirical offset of each channel's pointing,
twelve numbers of at most 0.17″ (0.22 px), which bring the registration to
0.09 and 0.06 px, 1.5 and 0.6 km/s; the model carries them as an option,
off by default, since no mechanism stands behind them, and an inversion
can be run with and without them.  The three dark frames that
close the flight are extrapolated, and He I is measured there only to
0.8 px in the worst channel; the metric is what would exclude them from
an inversion.  For scale, the quiet-Sun velocities ESIS measures are of
order 10 km/s, and the tile-to-tile scatter along the dispersion, which
contains the real Doppler structure of the scene as well as noise, is 3.4
and 2.3 km/s per 105″ tile through the middle of the flight.  The
focus of each sector is a physical term, four numbers per frame fitted
to six measured components and smoothed in time; the motion it accounts
for, and the caveat that the edges it rests on are soft, are described
under the lessons below.  In the candidate run that preceded the
committed one, dropping the common defocus from an otherwise identical
chain raised the rms over the flight from 0.226 to 0.285 px at He I and
from 0.180 to 0.233 px at O V; the sectors take out most of the rest, at
no cost to the fit against AIA, whose correlations do not depend on
them.

What limits the coalignment, and what it taught us
--------------------------------------------------

The floor of the measurement is set by the scene, not by the detector.
A 105″ tile of quiet Sun cross-correlated between two channels locates
their relative shift to about 0.2 px, and the median over the field to
about 0.05 px; the tiles' scatter about the median, once the linear
distortion modes are removed, is uncorrelated from tile to tile, so what
remains is not distortion.  Part of that scatter is not noise at all but
signal: a feature moving at 10 km/s is displaced by half a pixel along
each channel's dispersion, in a different direction in each channel, so
real velocity structure appears to the correlation as misregistration
that differs from tile to tile.  In the median over the field it cancels,
because the net flow of the quiet Sun is small; in the tiles it cannot,
and a coalignment measured this way cannot be pushed far below the
Doppler content of the scene.  Four lessons follow for an instrument of
this kind.

*A zero-order image would remove the two degeneracies the data could not
break.*  Every ESIS channel is dispersed, so a uniform Doppler shift of
the whole field, a slow defocus of the primary, and a lateral shift of
the sensor along the dispersion all move a channel's image along its own
dispersion with the edges fixed, and the four channels can only tell one
another how the shifts differ.  An undispersed channel sharing the field
stop would anchor the sky absolutely and to a few hundredths of a pixel,
where the AIA proxy scene anchors it to half a pixel, and would separate
a common Doppler shift from a focus change outright.

*The field stop's edge was the calibration source, and its weak point.*
The octagon's image is what separated the pointing from the grating,
followed the drift of the optics through the flight and placed the
windows.  But the fit takes the edges for a rigid outline, and measured
side by side they are not one.  The He I window runs off the detector on
one side in every channel, and two channels lack an edge in the other
direction, so several windows are placed along an axis by a single edge.
The edges differ in sharpness from 0.7 to over 4 px, several sharpen or
soften by a pixel through the flight, their profiles are skewed, and the
two lines, which share one field stop and one grating, disagree on the
motion of the same side by up to 0.3 px over half the flight.  The
placement of a window from its edges is therefore uncertain by 0.2 to
0.3 px over half the flight, which is the size of the motion the focus
of each sector accounts for: the data alone cannot tell whether the
mirror's sectors moved each image inside a fixed window or the edges'
apparent positions moved over a fixed image.  A field stop imaged whole, with margin on
every side of every window, with edges verified sharp on the ground and a
deliberate fiducial, a notch or a step, in each side, would have decided
it, and would fix the rotation and the scale of every window as well as
its position.

*Microns matter.*  The primary's focus drifted 26 µm over the flight,
its sectors by up to 49 µm against one another, and the field stop moved
7 µm, and each moved the images by a few tenths of a
pixel: 1.6 px per 0.1 mm of focus, and a pixel per 4 µm of stop.  Either
an athermal metering structure between the primary and the stop, or a
way to measure both in flight, is worth more to the coalignment than any
improvement of the detectors.

*Dispersion and point spread.*  A registration error of a fixed fraction
of a pixel costs fewer km/s the higher the dispersion, so more dispersion
buys velocity precision until the Doppler smearing of the scene, half a
pixel per 10 km/s here, blurs the structure the correlation relies on;
the ESIS dispersion sits comfortably on the right side of that trade.
The channels' point spread functions differ with their gratings and
focus.  A correlation locates a symmetric blur without bias, but not a
skewed one: image structure follows the centroid of the blur and an edge
its median, so a skewed point spread that changes through the flight
moves the image against the window edges, differently in each channel.
The edge profiles are skewed and several change, which makes this the
leading candidate for the unexplained motion; it is not established.
Measuring the point spread of each channel on the ground, through focus,
is what would test it.

Figures
-------

Two figures carry the account.

**Figure 1, the fit at the reference frame.**  For each channel: the
Level-1 frame, the model image of the AIA proxy scene, and their
difference, at the reference frame.  It shows what is being fit and how
well, and the windows of the neighbouring lines on each sensor.
(``figures.py frame``)

**Figure 2, the flight.**  Five panels against time: the fitted pointing
in pitch and yaw; the drift of each channel's windows; the measured and
applied defocus of the primary as a whole; the focus of each sector about
that mean; and the coalignment metric of every channel against channel 1
with the acceptance threshold, and dash-dotted what the optional channel
offsets leave.  It shows the time-dependent motions the
model carries and that the channels stay registered to the threshold
through the flight.  (``figures.py flight``)

A third figure is worth considering if space allows: the degeneracy
diagram, the singular-value spectrum of one frame's Jacobian beside a
sketch of which motion moves the edges, the sky, or both.  The interactive
blink and channel-difference pages made by ``blink.py`` and ``coalign.py``
are the companion for the website; they cannot go in print.

Cost and repeatability
----------------------

One evaluation of the merit, a linearization of the channel and a
conservative regrid of the scene onto the sensor, takes 1.1 s at the 401
sample scene on a 2026 laptop, on its GPU or on one CPU core alike, and the
same on a cluster GPU node: the cost is the linearization and the Python
around it, not the regrid.  The stages cost, in evaluations per channel:
the capture about 11 000 (a population of 135 for 80 generations) and its
polish 4 000; the outline stage 1 000; the shared polish 2 000 to 5 000;
each frame's pointing 300 across the four channels.  Measured wall times
on the cluster, one GPU and 16 cores per job:

==================  ==========  ======================================
stage               wall time   parallel over
==================  ==========  ======================================
capture             1.1–1.9 h   the four channels
window edges        8 min       —
outline and shared  2.6 h       the four channels (eight workers)
focus history       46 min      —
pointing            8–17 min    the thirty frames
acceptance          36 min      —
pages               10–30 min   —
==================  ==========  ======================================

With the channels and the frames spread over the cluster the chain is
about six hours end to end.  On one machine that runs four processes at a
time it is about nine hours, and serially about a day; a laptop with a
GPU is no faster than one without.  What stops a laptop today is memory,
not time: loading one frame peaks at 90 GB because the AIA proxy scene is
built as a full-resolution cube before it is resampled, although the data
in use are 3 GB.  Caching the resampled scene per frame would bring the
peak to a few gigabytes and the chain within reach of a 32 GB machine in
a working day.

Repeatability was measured by running the whole chain again from a
capture with a different seed, on the chain before the focus of each
sector was added.  Everything the data determine repeats:
the correlations with the reference frame agree to 0.012 after the
capture and to 0.002 after the shared polish, the held-out correlations
to 0.002, the outline residuals to 0.1 px, and the coalignment metric
over the flight to 0.02 px rms.  The parameters do not: the two seeds
differ by up to 1.3′ in grating yaw, 1.5 mm in sensor distance and 1 mm
in sensor position, along the null directions the frame cannot see, and
the mapping they describe differs by up to a pixel at the edge of the
field.  The absolute placement of the sky on the sensor is therefore
repeatable to about half a pixel, which is what the AIA proxy scene can
give, while the registration of the channels against one another is
repeatable to a few hundredths.  The whole chain took six hours of
wall time on the cluster.
